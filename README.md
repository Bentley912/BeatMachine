Simple Drum Kit made with Vanilla JS


Hey visitor!! 

This is an exercise in the JS for 30 day Challenge. I have been teaching myself web development in my spare time. 
But I am challenging myself to conquer more concepts. I want to master the simple ones and learn more about complex concepts. 

So this was a simple drum kit using Vanilla JS. I was able to practice on simple JS concepts like functions and constants. I also was able to gain a better understanding of simple JS. I have mostly utilized JQuery and this made me use only JS to code this. 

Possible Additions:

-Only the home keys are represented in the first version. It would be great to create rows representing the other keys and connect some awesome sounds to those as well.   

- Changing the background picture and paying around with the overall design of this would be great as well.
